# Project---Game-in-Python
First game in python named snake, gun and water
This Python project is a simple implementation of the classic game "Snake, Gun, and Water." 
The game allows the user to play against the computer by choosing between a snake, a gun, or water. 
The rules are straightforward: the snake drinks water, the gun shoots the snake, and water puts out the gun. 
The outcome of the game depends on the choices made by the player and the computer.
